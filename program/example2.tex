[pgndiagram] Great understanding of the game by Steinitz. He recognizes that
Black is not in control in the centre, so he begins a wing attack; And
immediately there comes a mistake. Chigorin plays according to the principles
of the old school: attack on a flank should be countered by the centar blow.
However, White's centre is very stable here;  }}}
